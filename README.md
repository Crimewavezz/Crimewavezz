### Hai, Crimewavez there! :octocat:

I'm an absolute coffee addict and wannabe software engineer who recently started his journey in "serious" programming and self-improvement, proud member of Emacs Church.\n\n
I absolutely love Linux and gaming, thus majority of my projects is falling in between of these two areas, currently I'm working on:

- Quakewavez - Having fun with Quake4 while learning C/C++, fixing bugs, modernizing engine and adding cross-platform support.
- ms2blend - Blender Export/Import plugin for models/skeletons created with Milkshape3D.
